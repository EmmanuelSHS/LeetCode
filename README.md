# LeetCode
The folder containing not only leetcode questions for algorithms & database.

But also the other classic algorithms.


LEET_Bit_Single_Number:

Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.


LINT_DP_longest_com_subseq.cpp:
    
    Given two strings, find the longest common subsequence.

    LCS is defined as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem.  


OTHER_DP_Min_Imbalance.cpp:

    Given an input of array a and a partition k, we split a[n] into k+1 subarray. 
    Also, let an Imbalance of Array defined as the largest distance from the sum of any
    subarray to the average of subarray (sum(a[n])/(k+1)).

    Output: a number of the Imbalance of Array s.t. its the smallest among all
    possible partitions given a[n] & k.
